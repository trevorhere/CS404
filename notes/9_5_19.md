Stuart Russel, wrote many initial AI books, tries to replace Asamovs 3 laws of robotics

Assamov's three laws:
* Dont hurt them, allow them to come to harm
* Robot obeys human unless contradicts first
* Protect own existance unless contradicting the first & second

Human compatible AI
* AI is supposed to maximize human values, whatever the human would prefer
